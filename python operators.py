# Arthmetic Operators
x = 49
y = 8

print(x + y)
# list: + , - , * , /,  %(Modulus) , // ( Floor Division), **(Exponent)

print('Modulus', 10 % 3)
print('Floor Divison', 10 // 3)
print('Division', 10 / 3)
print('Exponent', 3**4)

# Assignment Operators
x = 2  # Value assign
y += 3  # y = y+3
y -= 3  # y = y-3
y *= 3  # y = y-3

# Comparison Operators

3 > 2  # ( is 3 is greater than 2, )
3 >= 2  # ( is 3 is greater than or equal to 2, )
3 < 2  # ( is 3 is less than 2, )
3 <= 2  # ( is 3 is less than or equal to 2, )
x == y  # is x  equal to y
x != y  # is x not equal to y

# Multiple Comparison 

3 > 2 or 3 <2 # if Any conditon is true , it will return true
3 > 2 and 3 <2 # if all conditon is true , it will return true
not 3 > 2 and 3 <2 # if all conditon is true , it will return true
